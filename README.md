## 📦 Projects Included

### 1. 🤟 ASL Detection (American Sign Language)
- Detects and classifies ASL gestures from live webcam input.
- Built using a CNN model trained on ASL hand signs.
- Uses MediaPipe for efficient hand tracking.

### 2. 😀 Emotion Detection
- Real-time facial emotion recognition (happy, sad, angry, etc.)
- Powered by OpenCV for face detection and a trained CNN for classification.
- Supports webcam-based live prediction.

### 3. ✍ Gesture-Based Writing System
- Write characters on screen using hand gestures.
- MediaPipe tracks hand movement and OpenCV visualizes strokes.
- Can recognize and translate shapes to text with classification logic.

### 4. 🖱 Gesture-Based Mouse Control
- Control cursor and click using hand gestures.
- Includes features like:
  - Cursor movement
  - Click gestures
  - Scroll gestures
- Built with MediaPipe + pyautogui for mouse simulation.

### 5. 🔊 Gesture-Based Volume Controller
- Adjust system volume using hand distance.
- Thumb and index finger pinch controls volume level in real-time.
- Requires `pycaw` (Windows) for volume manipulation.

### 6. 🧑‍💼 AI-Based Attendance System
- Face recognition-based attendance marking.
- Recognizes faces from a pre-trained dataset.
- Logs attendance with date & time into a CSV file.
