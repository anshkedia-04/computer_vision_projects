## 🚀 Projects Overview

### 1. AI Attendance System
📌 Detects faces in real-time and automatically marks attendance with timestamps.  
✅ Prevents proxy  
✅ Stores data in CSV  

### 2. Gesture Writing
📌 Enables air-writing with finger tracking using MediaPipe.  
✅ Pinch to clear  
✅ Live canvas with drawing trail  

### 3. Mouse Control Using Gestures
📌 Move cursor, click, and drag using hand gestures.  
✅ Touchless interaction  
✅ Smooth gesture mapping  

### 4. Emotion Detection
📌 Uses CNN to classify emotions like Happy, Sad, Angry, etc. in real-time.  
✅ Real-time face detection  
✅ Trained on FER2013 dataset  

### 5. ASL Detection
📌 Recognizes static ASL signs (A-Z) using CNN model.  
✅ Real-time webcam-based recognition  
✅ Pre-trained with ASL dataset  

### 6. Volume Controller Using Gestures
📌 Adjust system volume using hand distance (thumb to index).  
✅ Real-time gesture-based control  
✅ Uses `pycaw` for Windows systems
